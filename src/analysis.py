            cases for  which each neighborhood has above average case counts (ie. "Neighborhood A"
            has 5 cases that are open for longer than the average of 10 days).

            Note: do not include a neighborhood in the `above_avg_neighborhood_counts` dictionary 
            if the count is 0 (only include neighborhoods that have atleast 1 case that took 
            longer than the average)
